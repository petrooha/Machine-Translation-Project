# ## Machine Translation Project
# In this notebook, sections that end with **'(IMPLEMENTATION)'** in the header indicate that the following blocks of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!
# 
# ## Introduction
# In this notebook, you will build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. Your completed pipeline will accept English text as input and return the French translation.
# 
# - **Preprocess** - You'll convert text to sequence of integers.
# - **Models** Create models which accepts a sequence of integers as input and returns a probability distribution over possible translations. After learning about the basic types of neural networks that are often used for machine translation, you will engage in your own investigations, to design your own model!
# - **Prediction** Run the model on English text.

# ### Verify access to the GPU
# The following test applies only if you expect to be using a GPU, e.g., while running in a Udacity Workspace or using an AWS instance with GPU support. Run the next cell, and verify that the device_type is "GPU".
# - If the device is not GPU & you are running from a Udacity Workspace, then save your workspace with the icon at the top, then click "enable" at the bottom of the workspace.
# - If the device is not GPU & you are running from an AWS instance, then refer to the cloud computing instructions in the classroom to verify your setup steps.

# ## Dataset
# We begin by investigating the dataset that will be used to train and evaluate your pipeline.  The most common datasets used for machine translation are from [WMT](http://www.statmt.org/).  However, that will take a long time to train a neural network on.  We'll be using a dataset we created for this project that contains a small vocabulary.  You'll be able to train your model in a reasonable time with this dataset.
# ### Load Data
# The data is located in `data/small_vocab_en` and `data/small_vocab_fr`. The `small_vocab_en` file contains English sentences with their French translations in the `small_vocab_fr` file. Load the English and French data from these files from running the cell below.

# In[4]:


# Load English data
english_sentences = helper.load_data('data/small_vocab_en')
# Load French data
french_sentences = helper.load_data('data/small_vocab_fr')

print('Dataset Loaded')


# ### Files
# Each line in `small_vocab_en` contains an English sentence with the respective translation in each line of `small_vocab_fr`.  View the first two lines from each file.

# In[5]:


for sample_i in range(2):
    print('small_vocab_en Line {}:  {}'.format(sample_i + 1, english_sentences[sample_i]))
    print('small_vocab_fr Line {}:  {}'.format(sample_i + 1, french_sentences[sample_i]))


# From looking at the sentences, you can see they have been preprocessed already.  The puncuations have been delimited using spaces. All the text have been converted to lowercase.  This should save you some time, but the text requires more preprocessing.
# ### Vocabulary
# The complexity of the problem is determined by the complexity of the vocabulary.  A more complex vocabulary is a more complex problem.  Let's look at the complexity of the dataset we'll be working with.

# In[6]:


english_words_counter = collections.Counter([word for sentence in english_sentences for word in sentence.split()])
french_words_counter = collections.Counter([word for sentence in french_sentences for word in sentence.split()])

print('{} English words.'.format(len([word for sentence in english_sentences for word in sentence.split()])))
print('{} unique English words.'.format(len(english_words_counter)))
print('10 Most common words in the English dataset:')
print('"' + '" "'.join(list(zip(*english_words_counter.most_common(10)))[0]) + '"')
print()
print('{} French words.'.format(len([word for sentence in french_sentences for word in sentence.split()])))
print('{} unique French words.'.format(len(french_words_counter)))
print('10 Most common words in the French dataset:')
print('"' + '" "'.join(list(zip(*french_words_counter.most_common(10)))[0]) + '"')


# For comparison, _Alice's Adventures in Wonderland_ contains 2,766 unique words of a total of 15,500 words.
# ## Preprocess
# For this project, you won't use text data as input to your model. Instead, you'll convert the text into sequences of integers using the following preprocess methods:
# 1. Tokenize the words into ids
# 2. Add padding to make all the sequences the same length.
# 
# Time to start preprocessing the data...
# ### Tokenize (IMPLEMENTATION)
# For a neural network to predict on text data, it first has to be turned into data it can understand. Text data like "dog" is a sequence of ASCII character encodings.  Since a neural network is a series of multiplication and addition operations, the input data needs to be number(s).
# 
# We can turn each character into a number or each word into a number.  These are called character and word ids, respectively.  Character ids are used for character level models that generate text predictions for each character.  A word level model uses word ids that generate text predictions for each word.  Word level models tend to learn better, since they are lower in complexity, so we'll use those.
# 
# Turn each sentence into a sequence of words ids using Keras's [`Tokenizer`](https://keras.io/preprocessing/text/#tokenizer) function. Use this function to tokenize `english_sentences` and `french_sentences` in the cell below.
# 
# Running the cell will run `tokenize` on sample data and show output for debugging.

# In[7]:

    print('Sequence {} in x'.format(sample_i + 1))
    print('  Input:  {}'.format(sent))
    print('  Output: {}'.format(token_sent))


# ### Padding (IMPLEMENTATION)
# When batching the sequence of word ids together, each sequence needs to be the same length.  Since sentences are dynamic in length, we can add padding to the end of the sequences to make them the same length.
# 
# Make sure all the English sequences have the same length and all the French sequences have the same length by adding padding to the **end** of each sequence using Keras's [`pad_sequences`](https://keras.io/preprocessing/sequence/#pad_sequences) function.

# In[8]:

# ## Models
# In this section, you will experiment with various neural network architectures.
# You will begin by training four relatively simple architectures.
# - Model 1 is a simple RNN
# - Model 2 is a RNN with Embedding
# - Model 3 is a Bidirectional RNN
# - Model 4 is an optional Encoder-Decoder RNN
# 
# After experimenting with the four simple architectures, you will construct a deeper architecture that is designed to outperform all four models.
# ### Ids Back to Text
# The neural network will be translating the input to words ids, which isn't the final form we want.  We want the French translation.  The function `logits_to_text` will bridge the gab between the logits from the neural network to the French translation.  You'll be using this function to better understand the output of the neural network.

get_ipython().getoutput('jupyter nbconvert *.ipynb')


# ## Optional Enhancements
# 
# This project focuses on learning various network architectures for machine translation, but we don't evaluate the models according to best practices by splitting the data into separate test & training sets -- so the model accuracy is overstated. Use the [`sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split()`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html) function to create separate training & test datasets, then retrain each of the models using only the training set and evaluate the prediction accuracy using the hold out test set. Does the "best" model change?
